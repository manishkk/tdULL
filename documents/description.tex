\maketitle

This is a placeholder description of the tdULL treedepth tool for the PACE 2020
Challenge on treedepth. A final version of the description will be made
available before the deadline.

The basic set-up of the tool is: a recursive branch-and-bound solution, that
recurs on separators generated by the algorithm described in \emph{Generating
All the Minimal Separators of a Graph} (Berry, Bordat, Cogis 1999), using a
SetTrie cache as described in \emph{Data structure for set containment queries}
(Savnik, Krnc, \v Skrekovski 2017) and (among other things) the linear-time
algorithm for treedepth on trees as described in \emph{Optimal node ranking of
trees} (Iyer, Ratliff, Vijayan 1988).
